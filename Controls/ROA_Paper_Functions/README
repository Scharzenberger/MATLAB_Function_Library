The Region of Attraction Toolbox (ROAtoolbox) is a collection of MATLAB
routines for determining the ROAs for autonomous nonlinear systems.
A user guide is under writing.

To use the ROAtoolbox, you will need the ToolboxLS which is developed
by Ian M. Mitchell for sovlving the time-dependent HJ PDE. you can get it at:

    https://bitbucket.org/ian_mitchell/toolboxls
The ROAtoolbox contains TooboxLS-1.1.1.

You can find the most recent version of ROAtoolbox at:

    https://

Before using ROAtoolbox, you will need to run a script file as follows.
Start MATLAB, change to the ROAtoolbox1.0/ directory, and run the
AddROAKernelPath.m file. This script will add path of the ROAtoolbox kernel and
ToolboxLS1.1.1 kernel to MATLAB search path.

Once you have ran AddROAKernelPath.m, you can try out ROAtoolbox as follows.
Change to ROAtoolbox1.0/Examples directory, there are 11 examples.
There are two script files in each example, run the RunProject.m file you can
get the results. You can modify the parameters in the SetProjectOptions.m file.

If you want to compute new system, just copy an example, rename it, modify the
model equation i.e. function GenVecField() in  SetProjectOptions.m.
